# GoStretch
## A cli tool for key stretching
---
### This algorithm uses between 512 and 4096MB of memory with sha512 hashing and concatenation, parallel brute force attacks become expensive.
### Compatible with the Rust Implementation [key_stretcher], but on my benchmarks this implementation is faster.
